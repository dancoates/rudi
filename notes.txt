Generator Shape

- template (The generated files - renamed to prevent conflicts, perhaps flat structure)
- output (is gitignored but can be edited)



Features:
- Can have multiple generators share some of the same files (auto recognise similarities?)
- Can run generator with a single command
- Can update generator by pointing it at a project that was generated by it and pulling differences back in
- Generators can extend from eachother

- Webpack plugin/loader style architecture to allow for complex merging of files. ie. a core plugin to allow merging of json files, but also yaml, toml and others


- Can be bundled without node?


Problems to solve:

How files are stored in the generator? - Probably better to use some sort of DB or git pack file thing so that you don't run into issues with hidden files or files that effect how node works?

Generators need to be separate and diffable though...




API

- `rudi gen <generator_name>`
- `rudi dev gen update` ?? - update a generator from source files

options
- Whether to nuke files that exist in the folder but not in the generator
